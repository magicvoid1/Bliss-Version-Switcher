1.0.7
--------------
- Fixed a bug where the 'SavePath' wasn't being updated correctly due to some old debug code

1.0.6
--------------
- Modify button will now automatically select the row that you were editing after you are done editing it.
- Fixed a bug where a user wasn't allowed to create an entry with no flags
- Fixed a bug where the application would still try to add/set the row when a person adds an entry without a version
- If the application detects that an Entries.txt file is corrupt, it will automatically delete the file and make a new one.
  * Which means you no longer have to actually go into your computer and delete this rogue file.
- The application now deletes the 'SavePath.reg' file when it's done using it

1.0.5
--------------
- Fixed a bug where the data folder wasn't being deleted from the backups when you deleted them from the D2's root directory
 (and thus were restored during the next version switch back).
- The drop down list that displays the available D2 versions is now editable. Which means that if Blizzard releases a new version that is
  not on the list, you will still be able to backup and manage that version within the switcher.

1.0.4
--------------
- Added a new 'Copy' button so that you can quickly insert new entries without having to type your Path or Flags again.
- Added 'Shift Up' and 'Shift Down' buttons so that you can quickly organize your list
- The application now remembers your previous version when you try to modify an entry and you toggle the 'Expansion' check box multiple times.
- When you 'Add', 'Delete', or 'Copy' an entry, the table will automatically select a remaining row. This also allows you to quickly copy and delete a lot of entries.
- Added 'Release Date' to the About screen.

1.0.3
--------------
- The application now supports using a 'data' folder. Meaning that the application will detect/copy/restore/delete your 'data' folders.
- Added some checks so that the modify/delete buttons don't complain about "No row selected" in the background of application. This was benign but caused a slight delay.
- Add/Modify/About buttons will now disable themselves when you are currently adding/modifying/viewing about, something. This prevents opening an infinite amount of add windows
  while never exciting the previous add window.
- Switched version input text fields to combo boxes. These combo boxes contain all the versions for classic and expansion. Selecting/Unselecting the expansion check box will
  dynamically update the list of available versions.

1.0.2
--------------
- Cleaned up some parts of the code
- Improved the file switching algorithms
- Removed a lot of debugging messages
- Switched UI from the native Windows look to the normal Java look

- Fixed a bug where the program wouldn't switch to the correct (expansion|classic) if the last
  version you ran was equal to the version you want to run for the other.
  
  * Example: If the last version you played was 1.13d expansion but then wanted to play 1.13d classic, it would open 1.13d expansion again.
  
- Fixed a bug where if you had one Diablo II version open, and you opened another version of D2, the registry values/save path would update
  but then the current running Diablo II game would be out of sync with the system values. Thus, now the program makes sure that you can only run
  multiple copies of identical version/type of the game. Meaning if you opened classic 1.06b, you can run another classic 1.06b, but you can't run
  classic 1.06b and then click on classic 1.09 (or expansion 1.09 or any other version that isn't classic 1.06b.. ok I think you get the point).

1.0.1
--------------
- Fixed a bug where the application wouldn't update the registry values the first time it was launched.
