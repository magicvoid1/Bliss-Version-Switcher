1.0.3
--------------
- The application now supports using a 'data' folder. Meaning that the application will detect/copy/restore/delete your 'data' folders.
- Added some checks so that the modify/delete buttons don't complain about "No row selected" in the background of application. This was benign but caused a slight delay.
- Add/Modify/About buttons will now disable themselves when you are currently adding/modifying/viewing about, something. This prevents opening an infinite amount of add windows
  while never exciting the previous add window.

1.0.2
--------------
- Cleaned up some parts of the code
- Improved the file switching algorithms
- Removed a lot of debugging messages
- Switched UI from the native Windows look to the normal Java look

- Fixed a bug where the program wouldn't switch to the correct (expansion|classic) if the last
  version you ran was equal to the version you want to run for the other.
  
  * Example: If the last version you played was 1.13d expansion but then wanted to play 1.13d classic, it would open 1.13d expansion again.
  
- Fixed a bug where if you had one Diablo II version open, and you opened another version of D2, the registry values/save path would update
  but then the current running Diablo II game would be out of sync with the system values. Thus, now the program makes sure that you can only run
  multiple copies of identical version/type of the game. Meaning if you opened classic 1.06b, you can run another classic 1.06b, but you can't run
  classic 1.06b and then click on classic 1.09 (or expansion 1.09 or any other version that isn't classic 1.06b.. ok I think you get the point).

1.0.1
--------------
